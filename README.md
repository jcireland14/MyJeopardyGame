# Jeopardy
My first project
## Overview

For project #1, I created a game of Jeopardy

Once players visit the site, they will be alerted to make a manual scoreboard and to follow the alerts on scoring through the game depending on if they answer the questions correctly or not.
Player(s) will be able to see the game board displayed and will take turns depending on how many teams they are playing with.  The player answering a question will double click on a value box containing a question under a specific category and will be prompted with the question and multiple choice answers. Then the player will input their answer and then, will be alerted whether or not their answer is correct or incorrect and to add or subtract the corresponding value of the question from their score.
After a question has been answered, that question button will be deactivated until the page is refreshed.
